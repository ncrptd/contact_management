# Contact Management API

This is a Node.js Express API for managing contact information using MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB installed and running (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Git installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/contact-management-api.git](https://github.com/ncrptd/contact_management-backend)
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd contact-management-api
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/contacts
   ```

   Update the `MONGODB_URI` value with your MongoDB connection string.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
